\section{Feature matrix} 
Finally, the evaluation results of three platforms are put together and incorporated into the feature matrix. The general structure of the matrix is showed in figure \ref{fig:featurematrix}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{adjustwidth}{-1.5cm}{}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=18cm,height=4.5cm]{images/feature-matrix.png}

\end{figure}

In the matrix, users has the flexibility to choose different priority for each criterion.
