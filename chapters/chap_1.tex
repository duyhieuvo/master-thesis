\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}
Nowadays there are hypes around the globe about Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligent (maybe reference) => what underline all of that is data. Data is the key and we need a huge amount of data. => Where are those data coming from? Machine auto generated, data from people interact with machines and services => The question is how to collect and integrate those huge amount of data (reference amazon has to deal with hug data) into our system and extract value out of it? One of the method to tackle this challenge is represent the flow of data as stream which can be ingest, process along the stream and produce new stream (reference here). 

A system following this concept must receive, persist and process data at a huge scale.  There are many technology to build up stream processing platform. People getting started will be flushed with many technology, platform and framework to persist the event, to process data in real time. 
\section{Motivation}
To develop a system evolving around streams of events, the primary basis is a central event store which can ingest data from multiple sources and serve this data to any interested consumer. Usually a \acrlong{esp} platform will be used as it is designed orienting to the concept of streaming. However, in order to choose the suitable platform, user will usually be burdened by a plethora of questions which need to be answered. The concerns include how well is the performance and reliability of the platform, does the platform provide the necessary functionalities, will it deliver messages with accuracy that meets the requirements, can the platform integrate with the existing stream processing framework in the infrastructure, to name but a few.

As there are many platforms now available on the market both open-source and commercial with each having different pros and cons, it could be challenging and time consuming to go through all of them to determine the most suitable option that matches the requirements. It would be greatly convenient to have a single standardized evaluation of these platforms which can be used as a guideline during the decision making process. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to derive a feature matrix to help systematically determine the right open-source \acrlong{esp} platform based on varying priority in different use cases. 
%Moreover, since many of the commercial platforms are built on top of open-source components with additional functionalities and management support such as Confluent Platform, Amazon MSK and Aiven on top of Apache Kafka, Stream Native Cloud and Pandio on Apache Pulsar
%There are so many platforms available on the market => it would be good to have a tool to determine which platform to choose. There are both open-source and commercial platform. However, most of the commercial platform are built-upon the open-source with added functionalities and support for management (example: Kafka has Confluent Platform and Confluent Cloud, Amazon MSK, Aiven for Kafka; Pulsar: Stream Native Cloud, Pandio) and open-source has fast development pace thanks to the huge community => This thesis will only evaluate the open-source platform.

%People who start to develop a system evolving around event streams will usually be overwhelmed by a plethora of available questions in order to choose the right technology. To store the streams of events, usually a \acrlong{esp} platform will be used as it is designed orienting to the concept of streaming. However, . Given that the amount of data which must be ingested, processed and moved around is enormous, the platform has to have great scalability. 
%Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to derive a feature matrix to help systematically determine the right \acrlong{esp} platform based on different priority in different use cases.


\section{Related Work}
There are a number of articles and studies which compare and weigh different platforms and technologies. Many of them focus on evaluating the performance between platforms. There are comparisons of time and resource behavior of Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar \cite{intorruk2019comparative} \cite{benchmarkkafkapulsar}, time efficiency between Apache Kafka and NATS Streaming \cite{benchmarknatskafka}.

Some other surveys cover more platforms and a wider range of evaluating aspects such as the comparisons of Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar and RabbitMQ from Confluent \cite{overallcomparekafka} \cite{benchmarkkafkapulsarrabbitmq}. However, these assessments are conducted only briefly on the conceptual level. Apart from these studies, most of the scientific researches only concentrate on comparing different stream processing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink and Apache Storm \cite{karimov2018benchmarking} \cite{isah2019survey} \cite{lopez2016performance}. Therefore, in general, there is still lack of in-depth investigation into the differences of \acrlong{esp} platforms and their conformability with event-driven use cases and this is where the thesis will fill in.
 
\section{Contribution}
In this thesis, three open source \acrlong{esp} platforms, namely, Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar and NATS Streaming are selected for evaluation based on preliminary measures and reasoning. Each platform is assessed against a set of criteria covering all important quality factors. The results are summarized in the form of a feature matrix with adjustable weighting factors of quality categories and features. Therefore, the matrix can be tailored to the need of user and adapted to individual use case to determine the most suitable platform for that case according to its priorities.

In the evaluation, sample implementations and code snippets are presented to illustrate the features of the platforms. Moreover, best practices for each platform in different use cases are also drawn out. These can be used as a reference for actual implementation of applications on top of these platforms.

\section{Organization of this Thesis}
The thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 gives theoretical background of the topics stream processing and \acrlong{esp} (\acrshort{esp}) platforms. Chapter 3 enumerates prominent open-source \acrshort{esp} platforms currently available and furthermore derives criteria to choose the top three platforms which are considered in this thesis. Chapter 4 elaborates the comparison metrics and the form of the feature matrix. After that, chapter 5 presents the evaluation of each platform against the comparison scheme and gives a discussion on the resulted feature matrix. Finally, the conclusion summarizes and proposes future improvement for the matrix.
