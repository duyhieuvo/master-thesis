\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}
Nowadays, the explosion of the number of digital devices and online services comes along with an immense amount of data that is auto generated or collected from the interactions of users. For instance, from 2016, the Netflix company already gathered around 1.3 PB of log data on a daily basis \cite{netflixpipeline}. With this unprecedented scale of input data, companies and organizations have tremendous opportunities to utilize them to create business values. Many trending technologies such as Big Data, Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligent all involves handling data in great volume. However, this also brings about a challenge to collect these data fast and reliably.
 

Once the data is ingested into the organization, it needs to be transformed  and processed to extract insights and generate values. In the context of enterprise applications, as the systems grows over time with more services, the need for an effective data backbone to serve these huge amount of data to these services and to integrate them together while maintaining a good level of decoupling becomes inevitable.

Moreover, all these steps of collecting, processing and transferring data must be done in real-time fashion. One of the prominent approaches is \acrfull{esp} which treats data as a continuous flow of events and use this as the \emph{central nervous system} of the software systems with event-driven architecture.
 
\section{Motivation}
To develop a system evolving around streams of events, the primary basis is a central event store which can ingest data from multiple sources and serve this data to any interested consumer. Usually an \acrshort{esp} platform will be used as it is designed orienting to the concept of streaming. However, in order to choose the suitable platform, users will usually be burdened by a plethora of questions which need to be answered. The concerns include how well is the performance and reliability of the platform, does the platform provide necessary functionalities, will it deliver messages with accuracy that meets the requirements, can the platform integrate with the existing stream processing framework in the infrastructure, to name but a few.

As there are many platforms now available on the market both open-source and commercial with each having different pros and cons, it could be challenging and time-consuming to go through all of them to choose the most suitable option that matches the requirements. It would be greatly convenient to have a single standardized evaluation of these platforms which can be used as a guideline during the decision-making process. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to derive a feature matrix to help systematically determine the right open-source \acrshort{esp} platform based on varying priority in different use cases. 

%Moreover, many of the commercial platforms are simply managed services with additional functionalities of the open-source platforms such as Confluent Platform, Amazon MSK, Aiven on top of Apache Kafka, Stream Native Cloud and Pandio on Apache Pulsar. Thus, only open-source platforms are considered in the thesis.

\section{Related Work}
%There are a number of articles and studies which compare and weigh different platforms and technologies. Many of them focus on evaluating the performance between platforms. There are comparisons of time and resource behavior of Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar \cite{intorruk2019comparative} \cite{benchmarkkafkapulsar}, time efficiency between Apache Kafka and NATS Streaming \cite{benchmarknatskafka}.

There are a number of articles and studies which compare and weigh different platforms and technologies. However, most of them only focus on evaluating the performance between platforms \cite{benchmarkkafkapulsarrabbitmq} \cite{benchmarkfull} \cite{benchmarkkafkapulsar}.

Some other surveys cover more platforms and a wider range of evaluating aspects such as the comparison of Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar and RabbitMQ from the company Confluent \cite{overallcomparekafka}. However, these assessments are conducted only briefly on the conceptual level. Apart from these studies, most of the scientific researches only concentrate on comparing different stream processing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink and Apache Storm \cite{karimov2018benchmarking} \cite{isah2019survey}. Therefore, in general, there is still lack of in-depth investigation into the differences of \acrshort{esp} platforms and their conformability with event-driven use cases and this is where the thesis will fill in.
 
\section{Contribution}
In this thesis, three open source \acrshort{esp} platforms, namely, Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar and NATS Streaming are selected for evaluation based on preliminary measures and reasoning. Each platform is assessed against a set of criteria covering all important quality factors. The results are summarized in the form of a feature matrix with adjustable weighting factors of quality categories and features. Therefore, the matrix can be tailored to the needs of different users and adapted to individual use case to determine the most suitable platform for that case according to its priorities.

In addition to the theoretical evaluation, a sample implementation is presented to illustrate and analyze the message delivery features of the platforms. Some important remarks for each platform are also drawn out. These can be used as a reference for actual implementation of applications on top of these platforms or for further evaluation.
\section{Novatec Consulting GmbH}
This thesis is written with the support and supervision from Novatec Consulting GmbH. Novatec is an independent IT specialist with the headquarter located in Leinfelden-Echterdingen and 8 more branches across Germany and Spain. Its portfolio includes both development services and consultation in various aspects such as IT Architecture and Cloud, Data Intelligence, Business Process Management, Security.

At Novatec, one of the main aspects of consultation on IT Architecture and Cloud is application integration with the focus on the topics of event-driven architecture, event streaming. The practice Agile Integration, which is accountable for this consultation fields, supervises this thesis and provides great support on the topic event stream processing as well as industrial technologies in general. 

\section{Organization of this Thesis}
The thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 gives a short theoretical background of the topics event-driven architecture, stream processing and \acrshort{esp} platforms. Chapter 3 enumerates prominent open-source \acrshort{esp} platforms currently available and furthermore derives criteria to choose the top three platforms which are considered in this thesis. After that, chapter 4 presents the evaluation of each platform against the comparison scheme and an elaboration of the resulted feature matrix. In chapter 5, one specific aspect of the platforms, namely, message delivery guarantee, is studied and evaluated in more detail through the implementation of a simple use case. Finally, the conclusion summarizes the thesis and proposes future enhancement.
